Characteristics: strong obligation strength, no contradictions detected, clear payment timeline with specific amounts, natural speech patterns, stable call quality. Recommended action: auto_clear or flag_for_review depending on fraud likelihood. If fraud likelihood is 'low' and confidence is above 0.7, auto-clearing is appropriate.",

    "content": "Risk scores between 41 and 70 indicate moderate risk requiring attention. Mixed signals are typically present: partial commitments, some evasion, or mild contradictions. When obligation strength is 'moderate' and sentiment shows stress without aggression, the situation often reflects genuine financial difficulty rather than fraud. Recommended action: flag_for_review. If behavioral flags exceed 2, escalate to manual_review.",

Recommended action: manual_review with compliance escalation if fraud likelihood exceeds 0.7. Key indicators at this level: multiple behavioral flags (3+), weak or absent payment commitment, contradictions detected, and stressed or hostile sentiment.

Moderate obligation (partial specifics or mild conditionality) is neutral. Weak obligation (no specifics, high conditionality, vague timeline) increases effective risk by 10-15 points. When obligation strength is 'weak' and risk score is above 60, the call should always be flagged for manual review regardless of other signals.",

Low call stability alone does not indicate fraud — it may reflect poor network conditions. However, when low stability is combined with suspicious speech naturalness, the probability of call manipulation increases by 40%. If both audio_trust_flags include 'low_call_stability' and 'unnatural_speech_pattern', the recommended action should be elevated by one level (e.g., flag_for_review becomes manual_review).",
