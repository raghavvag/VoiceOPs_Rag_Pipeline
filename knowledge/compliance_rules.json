    "content": "As per RBI circular on fair practices in debt collection, verbal commitments made during collection calls must be recorded with appropriate disclosure. Any verbal promise to pay must note the conditionality level, and conditional promises should not be treated as confirmed commitments. Agents must clearly inform the customer that the call is being recorded and that verbal commitments will be documented for follow-up purposes.",

    "title": "Verbal Commitment Assessment Guidelines",
    "content": "Verbal commitments with high conditionality should not be treated as binding agreements. Assessors must note conditionality level and recommend verification. When a customer uses phrases like 'I will try', 'if possible', or 'maybe', the commitment should be classified as conditional and flagged for follow-up rather than accepted as a confirmed repayment plan. Documentation must reflect the conditional nature of any such promise.",

Approved terminology includes: 'high-risk indicators', 'unreliable commitment pattern', 'requires verification', 'fraud-adjacent behavior', 'elevated risk profile'. Using prohibited language may expose the organization to defamation claims and regulatory penalties under consumer protection laws.",

These metrics should only be used for risk assessment purposes and must not be shared externally without proper anonymization.

The escalation report must include: call summary, matched risk patterns, NLP-derived signals, and the grounded assessment. Automatic clearing of high-risk calls is prohibited without human review. Medium-risk calls with fraud likelihood between 0.4 and 0.7 should be flagged for supervisor review within 48 hours.",
